# Security Policy

We take the security of our meal delivery app project seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in our application, backend API, or any part of this project, we encourage you to report it to us responsibly.  Responsible disclosure helps us to address vulnerabilities effectively and minimize potential harm to our users.

**Please do NOT publicly disclose security vulnerabilities in GitHub issues or public forums.**  Instead, please use the following process:

1.  **Email us directly:**  Send an email to our dedicated security team at [**bonyyamin1997@gmail.com**].

2.  **Encrypt Sensitive Information (Optional but Recommended):** If your report contains sensitive information, consider encrypting your email using PGP/GPG and including your public key in this `SECURITY.md` file, or by exchanging public keys via a secure channel beforehand. [**If you use PGP, add your public key block here or link to it**].

3.  **Provide Detailed Information:** In your email, please include as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including:
    *   **Project Name(s) and Version(s) Affected:** Specify which part of the project is affected (User App, Admin Panel, Delivery App, Backend API) and any relevant version numbers or commit hashes if possible.
    *   **Description of the Vulnerability:**  Clearly explain the nature of the vulnerability. What security impact could it have?
    *   **Steps to Reproduce:**  Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability. Include any necessary code snippets, screenshots, or video demonstrations if helpful.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  Describe the potential consequences of the vulnerability if exploited (e.g., data breach, unauthorized access, service disruption).
    *   **Your Contact Information (if you wish to be acknowledged):** Let us know if you'd like to be acknowledged for your responsible disclosure (we are happy to credit security researchers who help us improve our security).

## Supported Security Policies

[**In this section, document any formal security policies you have in place. If you are just starting out, you might not have many yet. Be honest and realistic.  If you *don't* have formal policies yet, you can state that and outline your *intentions* to implement them in the future.**]

**Example (Adapt to your reality):**

> Currently, we are actively working to implement the following security measures:
>
> *   **Regular Security Audits:** We intend to conduct [Frequency - e.g., periodic, semi-annual] security audits of our codebase and infrastructure.
> *   **Dependency Security Scanning:** We plan to use automated tools to scan our dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
> *   **Secure Coding Practices:** We are committed to following secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
> *   **Penetration Testing (Future Goal):**  We aim to engage with security professionals to perform penetration testing of our applications in the future to identify potential weaknesses.
>
> **At this time, we do not have a formal bug bounty program.** However, we deeply appreciate responsible vulnerability disclosures and will acknowledge researchers who contribute to improving our project's security.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely and responsible manner.  Here is our typical vulnerability handling process:

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within [**10:00 am to 6:00 pm - Sunday to Thursday **]
2.  **Triage and Analysis:** Our security team will triage and analyze the reported vulnerability to assess its impact and severity.
3.  **Resolution:** We will work to develop and deploy a fix or mitigation for the vulnerability. Our target resolution timeframe will depend on the severity and complexity of the issue, but we aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
4.  **Disclosure (Coordinated):**  We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure. We will discuss a public disclosure timeline with you after a fix has been developed and tested.  We aim to release security advisories to inform our users about resolved vulnerabilities.
5.  **Acknowledgement (Optional):** With your permission, we will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure in our security advisories and potentially in a dedicated section of this `SECURITY.md` file.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.  This means:

*   **Reporting Privately First:** Contacting us directly at [**bonyyamin1997@gmail.com**] instead of publicly disclosing the vulnerability.
*   **Providing Reasonable Time for Resolution:** Giving us a reasonable timeframe to investigate and fix the vulnerability before publicly disclosing it. We appreciate your patience and cooperation.
*   **Avoiding Exploitation:**  Not exploiting the vulnerability for malicious purposes, data exfiltration, or system disruption.
*   **Providing Sufficient Detail:**  As outlined in the "Reporting Security Vulnerabilities" section, provide enough information for us to understand and reproduce the issue.
